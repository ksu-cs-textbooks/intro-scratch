    <title>change y by () :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/02-blocks/04-motion/13-change-y-by/</link>
    <description>The change y by () block changes the sprites y-coordinate by the supplied value. For example, if the sprite was currently at y: 130, and the value of -10 was supplied to this block, the new value would be x: 120.&#xA;Notes The movement is instantaneous. If the desired position has off-stage coordinates these will be clamped to the max/min allowable coordinate to keep the sprite on-stage. I.e. attempting to change a spriteâ€™s y position by -400 would instead set its y position to -180.</description>
