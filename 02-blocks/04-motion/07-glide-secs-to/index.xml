    <title>glide () secs to () :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/02-blocks/04-motion/07-glide-secs-to/</link>
    <description> The glide () secs to () block moves the sprite to the specified location over the specified number of seconds. Possible locations include:&#xA;random position - randomly chosen coordinates on-stage mouse pointer - the location of the mouse cursor at the moment this block is executed The position of other sprites in the project at the moment this block is executed Notes The names of other sprites only appear in the list after they have been added to the project When a sprite is chosen as the target, the position used is always that of the original sprite, not one of its clones </description>
