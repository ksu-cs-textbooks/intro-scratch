      <description>The motion blocks control the motion of the sprite across the stage. In working with these blocks, it is important to remember the coordinate system Scratch uses, which is based on Cartesian coordinates. These consist of two coordinates, the first is along the x-axis (horizontal), and the second along the y-axis (vertical). The boundary of the stage is from -240 to 240 on the x-axis, and -180 to 180 on the y-axis.</description>

      <description>The move () steps blocks moves a sprite in the direction it is currently facing. Each step corresponds to one unit on the stage.&#xA;Notes The movement of this block is immediate. If you want the movement to be animated over time, use a glide block or repeat the move () steps alternated with a wait () seconds block. See the animated movement design pattern for details. The direction of the sprite may not correspond with the artwork of the sprite.</description>

      <description> The turn clockwise () degrees rotates the sprite in a clockwise direction by the specified number of degrees.&#xA;Notes In Scratch, the positive direction of rotation is clockwise In Scratch, and angle of 0 is straight up A Sprite’s appearance and direction may not correspond if it’s costume was not drawn facing upwards </description>

      <description> The turn counterclockwise () rotates the sprite in a counterclockwise direction by the specified number of degrees.&#xA;Notes In Scratch, the positive direction of rotation is clockwise In Scratch, and angle of 0 is straight up A Sprite’s appearance and direction may not correspond if it’s costume was not drawn facing upwards </description>
