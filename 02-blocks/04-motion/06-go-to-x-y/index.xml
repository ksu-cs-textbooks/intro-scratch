    <title>go to x: () y: () :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/02-blocks/04-motion/06-go-to-x-y/</link>
    <description>The go to x: () y: () block moves a sprite to the coordinates (x, y) provided they are on the stage.&#xA;Notes The movement is instantaneous. If you would like it to be animated over time, see the glide () secs to x: () y:() block. If the desired position has off-stage coordinates these will be clamped to the max/min allowable coordinate to keep the sprite on-stage. I.e. attempting to move a sprite to (6,300) would instead place it at (6, 180).</description>
