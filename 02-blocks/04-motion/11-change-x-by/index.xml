    <title>change x by () :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/02-blocks/04-motion/11-change-x-by/</link>
    <description>The change x by () block changes the sprites x-coordinate by the supplied value. For example, if the sprite was currently at x: 110, and the value of 10 was supplied to this block, the new value would be x: 120.&#xA;Notes The movement is instantaneous. If the desired position has off-stage coordinates these will be clamped to the max/min allowable coordinate to keep the sprite on-stage. I.e. attempting to change a spriteâ€™s x position by 600 would instead set its x position to 240.</description>
