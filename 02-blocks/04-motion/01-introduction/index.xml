    <title>introduction :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/02-blocks/04-motion/01-introduction/</link>
    <description>The motion blocks control the motion of the sprite across the stage. In working with these blocks, it is important to remember the coordinate system Scratch uses, which is based on Cartesian coordinates. These consist of two coordinates, the first is along the x-axis (horizontal), and the second along the y-axis (vertical). The boundary of the stage is from -240 to 240 on the x-axis, and -180 to 180 on the y-axis.</description>
