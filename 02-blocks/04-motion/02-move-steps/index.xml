    <title>move () steps :: Introduction to Scratch</title>

    <description>The move () steps blocks moves a sprite in the direction it is currently facing. Each step corresponds to one unit on the stage.&#xA;Notes The movement of this block is immediate. If you want the movement to be animated over time, use a glide block or repeat the move () steps alternated with a wait () seconds block. See the animated movement design pattern for details. The direction of the sprite may not correspond with the artwork of the sprite.</description>
