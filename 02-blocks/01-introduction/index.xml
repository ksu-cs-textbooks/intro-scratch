    <title>Introduction :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/02-blocks/01-introduction/</link>
    <description>As a block-based programming langauge, Scratch programs are built from snippets of code represented by blocks. These blocks have a quasi-puzzle piece shapes that helps indicate how they can fit together. Consider this example program that counts to ten:&#xA;Here we see a number of different blocks snapped tightly together to form a complete, simple program. This chapter will introduce the various blocks available in Scratch, as well as explain thier basic functionality and use.</description>
