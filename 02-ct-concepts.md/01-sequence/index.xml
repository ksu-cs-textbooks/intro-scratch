    <title>Sequence :: Introduction to Scratch</title>

    <description>At the core, a program is simply a step-by-step set of instructions the computer will carry out. In Scratch, these instructions take the form of blocks, which snap together in a sequence, which we typically refer to as a block stack (or stack).&#xA;For a sequence to be executed (carried out), it must start with a “hat” block, so called because its shape resembles a baseball cap:&#xA;This block indicates the conditions that will trigger the execution of blocks that are snapped into place beneath it.</description>
