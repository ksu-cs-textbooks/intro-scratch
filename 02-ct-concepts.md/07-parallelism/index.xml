    <title>Parallelism :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/02-ct-concepts.md/07-parallelism/</link>
    <description>Parallelism refers to doing more than one thing in parallel (at the same time). When we have two stacks of blocks both starting with a when flag is clicked, these both trigger thier execution when the green flag button is clicked, and appear to execute at the same time. Likewise, two stacks starting with when I recieve () blocks listening for the same message will be triggered at the same time.</description>
