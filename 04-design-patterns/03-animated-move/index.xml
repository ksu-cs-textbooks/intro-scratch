    <description>The move () steps immediately moves a sprite the specified number of steps. But what if we want that movement to be slower, animated over time? The various glide blocks provide smooth movement, but not in the direction the sprite is facing. Instead, we can emulate this movement with a combination of repeat (), move () steps, and wait () seconds blocks:&#xA;The total number of units moved is the product of the number of repeats and the movement in the block (i.</description>
