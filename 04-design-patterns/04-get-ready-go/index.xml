    <title>Get Ready and Go :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/04-design-patterns/04-get-ready-go/</link>
    <description>Sprites in Scratch maintain thier state - which means that if the program was stopped with a sprite in a certain position, the next time the program is run, it will begin in that position. But for many Scratch projects, we want every sprite to start in a known position, regardless of where it last was.&#xA;One common pattern to accomplish this using messages is the Get Ready and Go design pattern.</description>
