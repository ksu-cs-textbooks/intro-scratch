<p>Most programming languages have multiple ways to represent numbers. In particular, they make a distinction between (integers in mathematics) and those with a decimal point (called rational numbers in mathematics). The reason is that way we encode these values in binary is different. While we don&rsquo;t really need to understand the full details of this encoding, we do need to understand their implications</p>
<h1 id="integers">Integers</h1>
<p>In mathematics, integers are simply whole numbers - ones without a fractional part, i.e. (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). They can be negative or positive, and they go on to infinity and negative infinity, though we don&rsquo;t typically try to count that high.</p>
<p>We can convert a base 10 number to base 2 pretty easily.  Let&rsquo;s count to 7:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Base 10</th>
<th>Base 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>101</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>110</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>111</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that to represent larger numbers, we need more digits? So for 0 and 1 we only needed one binary digit, for 2 and 3 we needed two binary digits, and for 4 through 7 we needed three binary digits. To represent 8, we need four.</p>
<p>In fact, the maximum number we can represent in base 2 is determined by 2 to the power of the bits available, i.e. if we have 8 bits (binary digits), we can represent any number up to 255:</p>
<p>$$
2^8 = 256
$$</p>
<p>(Remember, we are also representing 0 in our 256 possible numbers).</p>
<p>For a computer&rsquo;s central processing unit to effectively do calculations, it needs to have a set amount of bits it can work with. Most modern computers use either 32 or 64 bit processors, meaning the largest positive integer they could represent are $2^{32} = 4,294,967,296$ and $2^{64} = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616$ respectively. However, that is not quite true, as we reserve one of those bits to indicate if the integer is positive and negative, and a couple of the largest possible values are reserved to represent special values like <em>infinity</em> and <em>not a number</em>.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to know all the exact details - just that an integer in any programming language will have a maximum and minimum possible value. If we think we might need a larger (or smaller) number than that, we&rsquo;ll need to use a different representation.</p>
<h1 id="rational-numbers">Rational Numbers</h1>
<p>In mathematics, Rational numbers are those that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers $p/q$ provided $q≠0$.</p>
<p>We typically represent these with a special binary encoding called <em>floating point</em> that uses one bit to represent if the number is positive or negative, some number of bits to represent the significant digits (the fraction), and a second number of bits to represent an exponent term used to determine where the decimal point should go. The representation is similar to scientific notation:</p>
<p>$$
\pm[fraction] \times 10^{[exponent]}
$$</p>
<p>This representation allows a very large range of numbers to be represented, at the cost of precision. Mixing very large and very small numbers in algebraic operations can exacerbate this loss of precision.</p>
<p>There is an alternate representation, <em>fixed point</em>, which uses a similar strategy to integers, with an assumed location for the decimal point. It represents a much smaller range of numbers, but</p>
<p>For most operations, we don&rsquo;t</p>
