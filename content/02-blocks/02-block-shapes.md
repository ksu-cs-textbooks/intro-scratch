Scratch blocks come in several shapes, which help identify how they can snap together and are intended to be used:

|Name|Shape|Use|
|---|---|---|
|Hat Block| ![Hat block shape](images/hat-block-shape.svg) |First block in a stack of blocks, and identifies what event will start execution of the block stack|
|Stack block| ![Stack block shape](images/stack-block-shape.svg) |The primary shape of block in a block stack, typically executes some kind of instruction| 
|Cap block| ![Cap block shape](images/cap-block-shape.svg) |Can only be used as the last block in a block stack as it ends the execution of the stack|
|C block| ![C block shape](images/c-block-shape.svg) |Also used in stacks, but allows for one or more stacks of blocks to be snapped inside that will be conditionally or repeatedly executed|
|Reporter block| ![Reporter block shape](images/reporter-block-shape.svg) |Snaps into the input field of another block, providing a value for that block to use|
|Boolean block| ![Boolean block shape](images/boolean-block-shape.svg) |Snaps into a boolean input field of another block, and provides a value of true or false|
