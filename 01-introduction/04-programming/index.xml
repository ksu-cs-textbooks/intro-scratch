    <title>Block-Based Programming :: Introduction to Scratch</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/intro-scratch/01-introduction/04-programming/</link>
    <description>Programming is essentially writing a set of instructions for the computer to carry out. These instructions are part of a programming language that has a well-defined syntax and grammar, and is in many ways similar to a human langauge (albeit with a much more limited vocabulary). For example, here is a program written in LOGO that moves a robot in a rectangle:&#xA;forward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100However, a computer can only interpret instructions that conform exactly to the syntax and the grammar of the language.</description>
