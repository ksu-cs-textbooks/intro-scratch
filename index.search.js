Scratch is currently in its third version, and can be used both online or as a desktop application. The online version can be reached at https://scratch.mit.edu, and can be accessed through your browser on any internet-connected computer. If you set up an account, your work will be stored in the cloud, and you can return to it at any time, from any machine you log in with. The desktop version can be downloaded from https://scratch.mit.edu/download and is available for Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, and Andriod. You do not need a Scratch account to use the desktop version, and projects created with it are stored on your local computer, not the cloud. Finally, if you are using this book for a K-State class, you will complete your assignments using a version of Scratch embedded in Codio. All three versions of Scratch are nearly identical, and we’ll call out what differences exist as we cover Scratch’s features.\nScratch builds upon a long history of teaching programming and computational thinking in schools, including the LOGO programming language and the work of Seymor Papert and the Squeak/eToys programming system. It incorporates many best practices and ideas derived from this proud history.",

    "content": "In 2006, Jeanette Wing published a number of papers arguing Computational Thinking - problem-solving approaches utilizing the power of compututers - were increasingly a fundamental skill needed by all students. She built her case on the recognition of the transformative effect computing technology and computational approaches were having on all disciplines in the late 20th and early 21st century (and not just the STEM fields)1. This helped inspire a national push to incorporate computational thinking into K-12 education as a new fundamental skill.\nBut what exactly is computational thinking? Essentially, it is solving problems like a computer scientist would. Typically this would mean studying a problem, then developing a program that can be run on a computer to solve it. Thus, computational thinking and programming are intractably linked, as one of the primary tools a computer scientist uses to solve problems is a programming language. But programming itself is not equivalent to computational thinking, no more than addition and subtraction are equivalent to mathematics, rather, programming is a tool utilized in computational thinking to express a problem-solving approach, much like addition and subtraction are used in mathematical equations. The ISTE and CSTA have developed an “Operational Definition of Computational Thinking for K-12 Education”2 that can be useful for an aspiring teacher:\nComputational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving process that includes (but is not limited to) the following characteristics:\nFormulating problems in a way that enables us to use a computer and other tools to help solve them. Logically organizing and analyzing data Representing data through abstractions such as models and simulations Automating solutions through algorithmic thinking (a series of ordered steps) Identifying, analyzing, and implementing possible solutions with the goal of achieving the most efficient and effective combination of steps and resources Generalizing and transferring this problem solving process to a wide variety of problems These skills are supported and enhanced by a number of dispositions or attitudes that are essential dimensions of CT. These dispositions or attitudes include:\nConfidence in dealing with complexity Persistence in working with difficult problems Tolerance for ambiguity The ability to deal with open ended problems The ability to communicate and work with others to achieve a common goal or solution Note that much of computational thinking is not specific to computer science - many are skills and dispositions used across multiple discipines. But an overreaching aspect of computational thinking is that how problems are formulated, data is organized, and models and simulations are represented are explicitly tied to the computer we are using to solve them.\nWing, Jeanette, “Computational Thinking”, Communications of the ACM, March 2006/Vol. 49, No. 3 ↩︎\nISTE and CSTA, 2011. “Operational Definition of Computational Thinking for K-12 Education” ↩︎",

    "content": "It is important to understand that different programming languages use different approaches to modeling computational processes carried out on a computer, much like different human languages use different ways of expressing ideas about the world. Thus, the expression of computational solutions you might build are heavily influcenced by the programming language you express them in. This also feeds into the problem-solving process (computational thinking), which will look different if you are using Scratch or if you are using Python, or any other language. That is okay, but you need to be aware of it because your approach to teaching computational thinking will necessarily depend on the language you are using as part of your instruction.\nWith this in mind, we turn to Brennan and Resnick’s Computational Thinking Framework1, which was developed specifically for the Scratch programming language consisting of seven concepts, four practices, and three perspectives, reprinted below:\nConcepts sequence: identifying a series of steps for a task loops: running the same sequence multiple times parallelism: making things happen at the same time events: one thing causing another thing to happen conditionals: making decisions based on conditions operators: support for mathematical and logical expressions data: storing, retrieving, and updating values Practices experimenting and iterating: developing a little bit, then trying it out, then developing more testing and debugging: making sure things work — and finding and solving problems when they arise reusing and remixing: making something by building on existing projects or ideas abstracting and modularizing: exploring connections between the whole and the parts Perspectives expressing: realizing that computation is a medium of creation, “I can create.” connecting: recognizing the power of creating with and for others, “I can do different things when I have access to others.” questioning: feeling empowered to ask questions about the world, “I can (use computation to) ask questions to make sense of (computational things in) the world.” The framework is also available as a handy one-page handout and website\nWe will refer to aspects of this framework throughout this book, so it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it..\nBrennan, Karen, and Mitchel Resnick. “New frameworks for studying and assessing the development of computational thinking.” Proceedings of the 2012 annual meeting of the American educational research association, Vancouver, Canada.

    "content": "Programming is essentially writing a set of instructions for the computer to carry out. These instructions are part of a programming language that has a well-defined syntax and grammar, and is in many ways similar to a human langauge (albeit with a much more limited vocabulary). For example, here is a program written in LOGO that moves a robot in a rectangle:\nforward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100However, a computer can only interpret instructions that conform exactly to the syntax and the grammar of the language. Thus, the following program would fail to work:\nForward 100 Right 90 Forward 100 Right 90 Forward 100 Right 90 Forward 100Can you spot the problem? answer… LOGO does not recongize the capitialized forward and right commands - it expects lowercase! Learning to program therefore involves several challenges - we must learn the syntax and grammar of a language, and a new way of thinking. This challenge is compounded by the need to get syntax and grammar exactly correct. Unlike a language arts teacher, who can see past typos and mispellings to understand our intent, a computer simply cannot.\nScratch and other block-based programming languages seek to make this learning process easier by reducing the cognitive load involved. In a block-based language, instead of typing code, blocks representing the code are dragged around the screen and “snap” together. This snapping only occurs when the block is in a location that is appropriate for the language, effectively making it impossible for the programmer to make syntax errors or mistype commands. This allows the learner to focus more on the logic of the program and how the computer actually interprets the code that we write.\nThat last bit, understanding how the computer processes our code, is an important part of developing our computer science skills. We sometimes call this having a “mental model” of the computer. If we have a good mental model, we can understand what a program does even without running it. So in this course, we’ll introduce not only the blocks that make up the Scratch language, but also aspects of how the Scratch Virtual Machine (its computer) makes sense of those blocks.",

    "content": "The Scratch editor consists of several parts, pictured below:\nStage Scratch is a multimedia programming environment, which means unlike most programming languages that write output to a text console, it displays its output graphically, as well as being able to play sounds through the computer’s speakers. The stage is where the program’s graphical output is displayed. This includes a background which can be changed (called the “Backdrop”), much like set dressing of a theatrical stage.\nThe “actors” on the stage are Sprites - a term that was borrowed from 2d computer games. A sprite is simply an image controlled by the program’s code. Sprites can be moved around the stage, and animated by switching the image they display (their “Costume”). Sprites can also display text in speech or thought bubbles, be scaled, have different graphical effects applied to them, and even be cloned. We’ll explore each of these concepts and how they correspond to ideas in Computer Science in future lessons.\nThe stage has a coordinate system which is based on Cartesian coordinates. It has an x- and y-axis, with origin in the center of the stage. The x-axis increases to the right, and decreases to the left, with the right edge of the stage at 240 and the left edge at -240. The y-axis increases in an upward direction and decreases in the downward, with the top of the stage at 180, and the bottom at -240. An angle of 0 points along the positive x-axis, and rotates counter-clockwise to 360 degrees.\nThe green flag at the top of the Stage acts like a play button on a DVD player - it runs the program. And the red stop sign stops the program. The other buttons switch between a small stage, large stage, or full-screen stage view.\nA Scratch program can be shared by embedding it in a website - when this is done, it often is displayed in a player-only mode, where all that is shown is the stage.\nSprite Pane The Sprite Pane allows you to select and display details about the sprites and the stage. The currently selected sprite (or stage) will have a thick blue outline around it. The details displayed at the top of the Sprite Pane include the name of the sprite, it’s x and y position on the stage, buttons to toggle its visibility, and its current size (as a percentage), and its rotation (an angle measured in degrees). Each of these is editable - you can change them by directly typing into the corresponding text bubble or clicking the show/hide button.\nCode Area The Code Area is where the code to control the currently selected sprite or the stage is displayed. A small semi-translucent image of the sprite/stage appears in the upper-right corner to help inform you which sprite (or the stage) you are currently editing. The bottom-left corner includes buttons for zooming in and out, while the button displaying the equal sign (=) will center the code in the Code Area, changing the zoom level as need to ensure that all code is visible.\nBlock Palette The Block Palette displays all of the blocks that are available to write your programs with. You write programs by dragging blocks from the Block Palette into the Coding Area and snapping them together. The available blocks are organized thematically (Motion, Looks, Sound, Events, Control, Sensing, Operators, Variables, and My Blocks), and clicking one of the categories on the far right will scroll to that block’s category in the Block Palette. Note too that all blocks from a category are the same color. We will discuss the specific blocks in much more detail in future lessons.\nIn the the lower-right corner of the Block Palette is a button that allows you to load Scratch Extensions, which provide additional functionality in Scratch. We’ll discuss some of them soon.\nHeader The header provides menu options for saving and loading projects, changing the language used by Scratch on its blocks and editor, and to display tutorials.\nOn the right side of the header are links for interacting with your account on the Scratch website, scratch.mit.edu. These will not appear in the desktop version or Codio.\nUnderneath this header are three tabs, Code, Costumes, and Sounds. We’ll explore these in future lessons as well - for now, we’ll focus on the Code tab.",
